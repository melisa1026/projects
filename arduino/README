This CEGEP project was to build a mini car that scans and drives around a maze, avoiding walls. 
Unfortunately, this was in the Winter 2019 semester and school went online,
so the car was never built and tested, but the code and simulation are complete.

I wrote the code with another group member, my part of the project was: 1) control the motor speed and turning depending on how far the walls are
                                                                        2) control the LED light
                                                                        
This video shows a simulation: The LED is on "Party mode" when driving straight, but when there is something in the way, it turns red, then shuts off until the way is clear.
Also, the motors can be seen speeding up, slowing down and turning in opposite or same directions (depending on target destination). https://youtu.be/RxsbimzZI0M
