These are 5 filters I made on Spark AR for Instagram, you can view them by clicking the links on a mobile device:

1) Umbrella Hat: This filter is a colourful umbrella hat that spins over your head while rain falls. For this filter I 3D designed an umbrella hat and raindrops on Blender.

2) Bee Halo: In this filter bees fly around your head. I 3D designed the bees and animated their wings to move on Blender.

3) Smile: This filter has two little people that try to pull the corners of your mouth up. When you smile, they fly away. For this filter I made 2D animations and used Saprk
          AR's patch editor to control the animations.

4) Yell: Using this filter, when you open your mouth it yells. I used Spark AR's patch editor to control the sound. (Only supported on Apple)

5) Snake Scarf: This filter puts a snake with a party hat around your neck. I 3D designed the snake and animated the toungue to go in and out on Blender.
