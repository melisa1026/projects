# my-projects

Hey,

This directory contains some of my projects, some were school projects and some are personal projects. 
Each folder has a README file with its project descriptions.

1) Unity games: I got into making games on Unity in the summer (2021) and this folder contains the games I have made since then. I created the C# scripts, drawings and animations for these games.

2) Grocery Store Website: This is an html/js/css/php shopping website, created as a school project.

3) Instagram filters: These are some filters I made for Instagram on Spark AR. I created functionality in some of the filters using Spark AR's patch editor. I also created 2D and 3D models/simple animations for them.

4) Arduino project: This is an Arduino mini car that avoids bumping into walls, created as a school project. (Unfortunately it was not physically built since school went online in the middle of the semester, but the code is completed with a simulation)

5) Animations: This folder contains animations that I made on Procreate and Flipaclip.
