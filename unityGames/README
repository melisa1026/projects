This folder contains games that I made on Unity,

I've posed C# scripts here, and the games can be played using this link: https://melpgames.itch.io/ 

Descriptions of the games:

1) Me, Myself & Witch: I made this game for a two week game jam. I learned how to include character customization and drawing features into my games.
                       I made all the art on Procreate and programmed the game on Unity.

2) Matching Game: This is a simple memory game against the computer. There are different levels of difficulty depending on who you decide to play against. 
                  
                  The levels work as follows:   easy level: the computer chooses cards at random
                                                medium level: the computer beggins with a small probability of getting a match, and the probability 
                                                              increases throughout the game (to simulate an average player)
                                                hard level: as soon as two matching cards have been flipped, the computer matches them on its next turn 
                                                            (to simulate my friend that's really good at the mathing game)
                                                cheater level: the computer plays at the medium level but cheats once in a while by opening three cards in one 
                                                               turn, or by stealing a point from the player.
                                                               
                  My sister and I drew the assets on procreate, and I wrote the C# code.
                  
                  Making this game, I learned how to manipulate GameObjects and their Transform component. I also got to think a lot about how to 
                  simulate a real person's moves

3) Poptropica island: As a kid, I loved the game Poptropica, which is an adventure game. I made my own version of it.
                      
                      In this game I drew the scenes and characters, and I created C# scripts to manipulate them.
                      
                      I learned how to make player controls from scratch (walking, running, jumping, crouching), I learned how to use
                      rigging for animation and how to create character customization.

Fun bonus: I made the music for my Whale Evolution game with GarageBand:) https://melpgames.itch.io/whale-evolution
