**Descriptions of some games:**

1) **Me, Myself & Witch**: I made this game for a two week game jam. I learned how to include character customization and drawing features into my games.

2) **Matching Game**: This is a simple memory game against the computer. There are different levels of difficulty depending on who you decide to play against. 
                  
      The levels work as follows: <br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*easy level*: the computer chooses cards at random<br/>
      
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*medium level*: the computer beggins with a small probability of getting a match, and the probability increases throughout the <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;game (to simulate an average player)<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*hard level*: as soon as two matching cards have been flipped, the computer matches them on its next turn (to simulate my friend <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that's really good at the mathing game)<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*cheater level*: the computer plays at the medium level but cheats once in a while by opening three cards in one turn, or by stealing<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a point from the player.


Making this game, I learned how to manipulate GameObjects and their Transform component. I also got to think a lot about how to 
simulate a real person's moves

3) **Poptropica island**: As a kid, I loved the game Poptropica, which is an adventure game. I made my own version of it.
                      
In this game I learned how to make player controls from scratch (walking, running, jumping, crouching), I learned how to use
rigging for animation and how to make an adventure game.
